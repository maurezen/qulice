Exclude

  You can exclude anything, using plugin configuration:

+--
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>com.qulice</groupId>
      <artifactId>qulice-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>${project.version}</version>
      <configuration>
        <excludes>
          <exclude>checkstyle:/src/examples/.*</exclude>
          <exclude>findbugs:~com.qulice.foo.*</exclude>
        </excludes>
      </configuration>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
+--

  Every <<<exclude>>> item is a regular expression. The following
  exclusion prefixes are supported now (the list may actually be longer):
  <<<checkstyle:>>>, <<<pmd:>>>, <<<findbugs:>>>, <<<codenarc:>>>,
  <<<dependencies:>>>, <<<cobertura:>>>, <<<jslint:>>>, <<<duplicatefinder:>>>.

  Exclude for CodeNarc is a bit different, as CodeNarc consumes ant-style
  expressions. For example:
  1) <<<codenarc:**/*.groovy>>> excludes all <<<.groovy>>> files in all
  folders;
  2) <<<codenarc:**/src/ex1/Main.groovy,**/src/ex2/Main2.groovy>>> excludes
  <<<Main.groovy>>> and <<<Main2.groovy>>> in appropriate packages.

  Exclude for Findbug is a bit different, as expression has to be either an
  exact class name or start with the ~ character the rest of content is
  interpreted as a Java regular expression. For example:
  1) <<<findbugs:~com.qulice.foo.*>>> excludes all classes in package
  com.qulice.foo;
  2) <<<findbugs:com.qulice.foo.Bar>>> excludes only class Bar in appropriate
  packages.
  See http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/manual/filter.html
  Only one exclude is supported for findbugs.
